# kindleMock
Programmatically building Kindle's library page using swift

This project was intended for learning purposes only.

Intent of the project was to test my swift UI skills by building the kindle library app programmatically
and fetching data from a JSON file to build the library.

The use of MVC paradigm to custom design the UI was used in this project.
